# Integration Tests for hyper-custom-cert

This directory contains comprehensive integration tests for all feature combinations of the `hyper-custom-cert` library.

## Test Organization

### Test Files

1. **`default_features.rs`** - Tests for default features (native-tls only)
   - Basic client creation and configuration
   - Timeout and header configuration
   - Verification that optional features are not available

2. **`rustls_features.rs`** - Tests for rustls features
   - Custom CA certificate loading via PEM bytes
   - Custom CA certificate loading via file paths
   - Certificate pinning functionality
   - Combined rustls configurations

3. **`insecure_dangerous_features.rs`** - Tests for insecure-dangerous features
   - ⚠️ **WARNING**: These tests cover dangerous functionality for development only
   - Insecure certificate acceptance
   - Static convenience methods
   - Security warnings and documentation

4. **`feature_combinations.rs`** - Tests for various feature combinations
   - rustls + insecure-dangerous combinations
   - native-tls + insecure-dangerous combinations
   - All features enabled scenarios
   - Method chaining and configuration order independence

5. **`example_server_integration.rs`** - Integration tests that execute requests against the example server
   - Comprehensive test suite that validates HttpClient against example server endpoints
   - Tests all feature combinations with realistic usage patterns
   - Covers basic client tests, feature-specific functionality, HTTP methods, and error handling
   - Works with current placeholder implementation while being ready for actual HTTP functionality
   - 24 comprehensive test functions covering various scenarios and feature combinations

## Running Tests

### Default Features Only
```bash
cargo test --tests
```

### With Rustls Feature
```bash
cargo test --tests --features rustls
```

### With Insecure-Dangerous Feature (Development Only!)
```bash
cargo test --tests --features insecure-dangerous
```

### With All Features
```bash
cargo test --tests --all-features
```

### Specific Feature Combinations
```bash
# Rustls + Insecure (unusual but valid combination)
cargo test --tests --features "rustls,insecure-dangerous"

# Native-TLS + Insecure (default + insecure)
cargo test --tests --features "native-tls,insecure-dangerous"

# No optional features (minimal build)
cargo test --tests --no-default-features --features native-tls
```

## CI/CD Integration

### Recommended Test Matrix

For comprehensive CI/CD testing, run tests with all major feature combinations:

```yaml
# Example for GitHub Actions
strategy:
  matrix:
    features:
      - ""  # Default features only
      - "rustls"
      - "insecure-dangerous"  
      - "rustls,insecure-dangerous"
      - "all-features"

steps:
  - name: Run integration tests
    run: |
      if [ "${{ matrix.features }}" == "all-features" ]; then
        cargo test --tests --all-features
      elif [ "${{ matrix.features }}" == "" ]; then
        cargo test --tests
      else
        cargo test --tests --features "${{ matrix.features }}"
      fi
```

### Test Categories

#### ✅ **Safe Tests** (Always Run)
- Default feature tests
- Rustls feature tests
- Basic functionality verification
- Method chaining and configuration

#### ⚠️ **Dangerous Tests** (Development/CI Only)
- Insecure-dangerous feature tests
- **NEVER** run these in production environments
- Only for development and testing validation

## Test Implementation Notes

### Conditional Compilation

Tests use extensive conditional compilation to ensure:
- Features are only tested when enabled
- Methods are not available when features are disabled
- Proper compile-time feature checking

### Placeholder Assertions

Current tests use `assert!(true)` placeholders because:
- Integration tests focus on compilation and API availability
- Actual HTTP functionality would require external dependencies
- Real network tests would be unreliable in CI environments

### Security Considerations

#### Rustls Tests
- Use test certificates and dummy data
- Verify proper feature gating
- Test CA loading and certificate pinning

#### Insecure Tests
- Include extensive security warnings
- Test dangerous functionality safely
- Verify feature isolation

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Mock HTTP Servers** - Add actual HTTP request testing
2. **Real Certificate Validation** - Test with actual certificate chains
3. **Error Condition Testing** - Test failure scenarios
4. **Performance Benchmarks** - Measure different backend performance
5. **WASM Integration** - Add WebAssembly-specific integration tests

### Test Coverage Goals
- [ ] 100% API surface coverage for all features
- [ ] All feature combination scenarios
- [ ] Error condition handling
- [ ] Performance regression prevention
- [ ] Security feature verification

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Choose appropriate test file based on feature requirements
2. Use conditional compilation (`#[cfg(feature = "...")]`)
3. Add both positive and negative test cases
4. Update this README with new test scenarios

### Feature Flag Guidelines
- Always test feature availability with `#[cfg(feature = "...")]`
- Test feature unavailability with `#[cfg(not(feature = "..."))]`
- Use `#[cfg(all(...))]` for multiple feature requirements
- Document security implications for dangerous features
